I am a Ph.D. student since October, 2017 in Toulouse (France) supervised by [Nicolas Dobigeon](http://dobigeon.perso.enseeiht.fr/index.html) and [Pierre Chainais](http://pierrechainais.ec-lille.fr), within the [SC](http://sc.enseeiht.fr/) group of the [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/) laboratory.
I am also affiliated to the [ORION-B project](https://www.iram.fr/~pety/ORION-B/).

Prior to that, I graduated from [Ecole Centrale de Lille](http://centralelille.fr/) majoring in data science. 
I also hold a M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from [University of Lille](http://www.univ-lille1.fr/home/).

I work on Monte Carlo methods for statistical machine learning and signal processing. I am particularly interested in the connections between optimisation and simulation-based approaches.
