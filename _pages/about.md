I recently (October 2020) obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Toulouse where I was supervised by [Nicolas Dobigeon](http://dobigeon.perso.enseeiht.fr/index.html) and [Pierre Chainais](http://pierrechainais.ec-lille.fr), within the [SC](http://sc.enseeiht.fr/) group of the [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/) laboratory.
Prior to that, I graduated from [Ecole Centrale de Lille](http://centralelille.fr/) majoring in data sciences. 
I also hold a M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from [University of Lille](http://www.univ-lille1.fr/home/).
In Spring 2019, I was a research visiting scholar at the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) of the University of Oxford working with [Arnaud Doucet](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/).
I am affiliated to the [ORION-B project](https://www.iram.fr/~pety/ORION-B/) which gathers astrophysicists, data scientists and statisticians in order to better understand the formation of stars in our universe.

## Research interests
My research interests lie in Bayesian modelling, the development of efficient computational methods for inferring unknown objects in complex problems and their applications to signal/image processing and machine learning.
My recent works focused on deriving a broad approximate statistical framework and associated Monte Carlo sampling approaches by taking inspiration from the *variable splitting* method in optimisation, e.g., used by quadratic penalty approaches and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).
