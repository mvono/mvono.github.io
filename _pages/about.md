I am a Staff Research Scientist at the [Criteo AI Lab](https://ailab.criteo.com/) in Paris.

Previously, I was a Research Scientist at the [Lagrange Mathematics and Computing Research Center](https://www.huawei.com/fr/news/fr/2020/centre-lagrange) of [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/) working with [Alain Durmus](http://alain.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) and [Eric Moulines](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=_XE1LvQAAAAJ&hl=fr).

I obtained my Ph.D. in statistics on October 7, 2020 from the University of Toulouse where I was supervised by [Pierre Chainais](http://pierrechainais.ec-lille.fr) and [Nicolas Dobigeon](http://dobigeon.perso.enseeiht.fr/index.html), within the [SC](http://sc.enseeiht.fr/) group of the [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/) laboratory.

In spring 2019, I was a research visiting scholar at the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) of the University of Oxford working with [Arnaud Doucet](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/).

I have been affiliated to the [ORION-B project](https://www.iram.fr/~pety/ORION-B/) which gathers astrophysicists, data scientists and statisticians in order to better understand the formation of stars in our universe.

## Research interests
My current research interests lie in federated learning, privacy-preserving learning and data valuation.

During my journey at Huawei, I worked on [distributed](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/plassier21a.html)/[federated](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00797) Bayesian approaches and privacy-preserving machine learning.
My Ph.D. works focused on deriving a broad [approximate statistical framework](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2020.1826954) and associated [Monte Carlo sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11937) approaches by taking inspiration from the [variable splitting](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2019.2894825) method in optimisation (e.g., used by quadratic penalty approaches).
