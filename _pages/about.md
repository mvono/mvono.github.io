I am a research associate at the [Lagrange Mathematics and Computing Research Center](https://www.huawei.com/fr/news/fr/2020/centre-lagrange) of [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/) working with [Eric Moulines](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=_XE1LvQAAAAJ&hl=fr) and [Alain Durmus](http://alain.perso.math.cnrs.fr/).

I obtained my Ph.D. in statistics on October 7, 2020 from the University of Toulouse where I was supervised by [Nicolas Dobigeon](http://dobigeon.perso.enseeiht.fr/index.html) and [Pierre Chainais](http://pierrechainais.ec-lille.fr), within the [SC](http://sc.enseeiht.fr/) group of the [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/) laboratory.

In spring 2019, I was a research visiting scholar at the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) of the University of Oxford working with [Arnaud Doucet](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/).

I am affiliated to the [ORION-B project](https://www.iram.fr/~pety/ORION-B/) which gathers astrophysicists, data scientists and statisticians in order to better understand the formation of stars in our universe.

## Research interests
My research interests lie in Bayesian modelling, the development of efficient computational methods for inferring unknown objects in complex problems and their applications to signal/image processing and machine learning.

My recent works focused on deriving a broad [approximate statistical framework](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2020.1826954) and associated [Monte Carlo sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11937) approaches by taking inspiration from the [variable splitting](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2019.2894825) method in optimisation (e.g., used by quadratic penalty approaches).
